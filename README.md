# Brad's Encryptor / Decryptor

Hello Friend!

Welcome to Brad's Encryptor/Decryptor

  Brad’s Encryptor/Decryptor is a multifunctional cryptography tool that can be used to make your private messages more secure.         First, please note that this project is in its ALPHA stage and I plan to make continuous upgrades in future that will boast the efficiency as well as the security of the device. I am open to suggestions so feel free to leave new ideas that you might have.  As for now I will answer some questions that you might have about the encryptor.

Why did you decide to make an encrypter?
   I decided to make an encryptor mainly to increase my knowledge on C#. I am a tactile learner at heart, meaning that I learn best by creating projects (such as this one) that can not only help me but also another people as well. By creating the encrypter I was able to refresh my knowledge on StringBuliders, If statements, as well as another important C# functions that substantially developed my skills as a programmer.
  	
How does the Encrypter work?
  (As for now) The Encrypter works by taking the letters in your message and replacing them with three-digit numbers. So a message such as “Encryptor” will look like “330450929311271309757430311” when it has been encrypted. After your message has been encrypted you can take the message to the Decryptor where it will decode the message for you. 

Why did you choose to scramble using three-digit numbers?
  Mainly for two reasons, 1.By using three-digit numbers the text appears longer and more complex than it really is, this in theory should throw off any computer that wishes to decrypt the message. I had considered using four-digit numbers however this makes the encrypted message absurdly long without adding a real benefit in efficiency.   2. It allowed me to apply C# functions to a real-world situation. Like I have previously mentioned I learn best through applying concepts to personal projects, and I personally feel that this was the best way to accomplish this. NOTE: I plan on adding new features to the program, such as encrypting using special characters.     

Does your Encryption device have real-world applications?
  I admit that I am no cryptographer, but I believe that this project can truly help those who use it and I plan on adding features that will make the encryptor more efficient in the near future. However most devices are capable of encrypting your messages by themselves and I suggest you rely on those instead because they are professionally made, but if you want a fun easy way to encrypt your messages than I believe the Encryptor is perfect for you.
